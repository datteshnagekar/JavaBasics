	 * The LinkedHashSet is Hash table and linked list implementation of the Set interface,
	 * with predictable iteration order. This implementation differs from HashSet in that
	 * it maintains a doubly-linked list running through all of its entries. This linked list
	 * defines the iteration ordering, which is the order in which elements were inserted 
	 * into the set (insertion-order). Note that insertion order is not affected if an element
	 * is re-inserted into the set. This class provides all of the optional Set operations, and
	 * permits null elements.
	 * Below example shows how to create LinkedHashSet object, adding elements to it,
	 * getting size of LinkedHashSet object, and is the set empty or not.
